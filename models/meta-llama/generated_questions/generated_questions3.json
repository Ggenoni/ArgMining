A useful critical question is one that challenges assumptions, demands justification, explores consequences, or considers alternative perspectives.\n**Intervention:**\nCLINTON: \"The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we 'll build together\nToday is my granddaughter 's second birthday\nI think about this a lot\nwe have to build an economy that works for everyone , not just those at the top\nwe need new jobs , good jobs , with rising incomes\nI want us to invest in you\nI want us to invest in your future\njobs in infrastructure , in advanced manufacturing , innovation and technology , clean , renewable energy , and small business\nmost of the new jobs will come from small business\nWe also have to make the economy fairer\nThat starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee , finally , equal pay for women 's work\nI also want to see more companies do profit-sharing\"\n**Guidelines:**\n- Provide exactly 3 questions.\n- Each question should be on a separate line.\n- Keep the questions concise.\n- Do not provide any explanation.\n- Do not add any comment before nor after the 3 questions.\n- Each question should challenge an assumption or inference in the argument, assessing claims, exploring alternatives, or testing feasibility."
